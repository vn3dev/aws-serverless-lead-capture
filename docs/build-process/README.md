# Build Process

This section documents the step-by-step implementation of the serverless architecture.

It covers the complete deployment process from initial setup to security hardening and operational considerations.

## Implementation Steps

- [00 - Pre-requisites](./00-pre-requisites.md)
- [01 - Static Website Hosting](./01-hosting-static-website.md)
- [02 - Lead Capture Endpoint](./02-lead-capture-endpoint.md)
- [03 - Persisting Leads in DynamoDB](./03-persisting-leads-in-dynamodb.md)
- [04 - Security Hardening](./04-security-hardening.md)
- [05 - Operational Roadmap](./05-operational-roadmap.md)

The build process follows a layered approach:
1. Infrastructure provisioning
2. Backend implementation
3. Data persistence
4. Security hardening
5. Operational improvements
